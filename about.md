Hi! I'm Jason Wang, a student at Duke University studying Computer Science with a certificate in PPE (Philosophy, Politics, and Economics). I'm interested in the intersection between technology and societal topics such as conservation, governmental efficiency, information + journalism, and agricultural technology.

### Readings from Jason Wang

Readings is an assortment of articles, released (ideally) twice every single week, that I've found to be noteworthy and important to remember! For me, it's meant to promote long-term memory about news and highlight some interesting tidbits of knowledge and opinions in the world. For my readers, it's intended to hopefuly encourage some foray or promote interest in the ethical use and implications of technology throughout our entire world. The current batch of *recurring* sources is WSJ, WIRED, MIT Technology Review, Nautilus, Stratechery, Aspen US, Hacker News, and ProductHunt.
