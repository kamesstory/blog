This issue starts a little meta, with an article focused on how news is useless and that people shouldn't waste their time reading it. I do think that there is a difference, however, between reading current news and reading long-form articles that introduce comprehensive opinions or overviews of situations. A lot of the articles I find myself interested in posting about are these types of information, which contribute to broad knowledge of the world that in many cases are also applicable to my learning as a student and as a technologist interested in how society is influenced by technology, as well as unrelated problems within society that are of critical importance. My pitch: read my recommendations or thoughts instead of fast-paced news!

### Readings:

| Article Title | Summary + Opinions |
|:--------:|:--------------------|
| [The New York Times sells premium ads based on how an article makes you feel](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2019/the-new-york-times-sells-premium-ads-based-on-how-an-article-makes-you-feel/) | From Poynter, a fascinating story about how the New York Times is now targeting ads based on "Feels", which doesn't gather data from users and instead focuses on placing ads that are related to how most users feel after they read the story. This is clever, of course, protecting privacy but also ensuring more accurate revenue. I'm inclined to believe this is good, even if psychological impacts are huge. This ties in pretty well with previous articles about the privatization of recommendations systems, like Canopy (which I have been fortunate to get into a beta for). Pretty effective! |

| [Why rich Americans believe they pay enough taxes, in 2 charts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rich-argument-against-higher-taxes-192358168.html) | From Yahoo Finance, two charts that show percentages of taxes paid in the US by the richest in society. It actually reveals information I didn't know before, like how the vast, vast majority of taxes are paid by the top half of society, and how the top 10% pay almost 70% of the taxes. Shocking, really. Not entirely sure how it changes my viewpoint about if the rich should still be contributing to the success of the general public, but intriging nonetheless. |

| [A leading AI conference is trying to fix the field’s reproducibility crisis](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/613297/the-biggest-ai-conference-is-trying-to-fix-the-fields-reproducibility-crisis/) | From MIT Technology Review, news that NeurIPS 2019 has introduced a policy that requires papers to meet some requirements of a reproducibility checklist, as the training of models currently makes it very difficult to reproduce research results. This is obviously disastrous for the field, considering legitimate science relies on the reproducibility of results to verify research. |

| [Two rival AI approaches combine to let machines learn about the world like a child](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613270/two-rival-ai-approaches-combine-to-let-machines-learn-about-the-world-like-a-child/) | From MIT Technology Review. NS-CL (DeepMind + IBM + MIT) reasons using symbolic representations of things (spatial relations, concepts of objects, etc), and can also use neural networks to recognize things. This symbiotic approach makes it incredibly powerful and also increases its ability to learn/act without nearly as much labelled training data. Cool implications! |

| [Want to Know How to Build a Better Democracy? Ask Wikipedia](https://www.wired.com/story/want-to-know-how-to-build-a-better-democracy-ask-wikipedia/?) | From WIRED. Wikipedia is a strong model for democracy because of the fundamental forces that drive it. Primarily, neutral contributors who want to create neutral and accurate information, while trying to avoid pitfalls and incentives from third parties who have their own agendas. In Wikipedia's case, paid advocacy is dangerous, even if increased scrutinization checks it, since the increased attention paid to the subjects of the advocacy tend to skew accuracy and attention towards certain information, and neglects other topics which might also be important. |

| [The New Science of How to Argue—Constructively](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/erisology-the-science-of-arguing-about-everything/586534/) | From The Atlantic. An interesting and critically important article, the study of debate, but some experts are arguing that a "new" field doesn't need to be created for the specific circumstances and characteristics of modern online debate. I'm not entirely sure I agree, however, given that the anonymity, rapid dissemination, and social dynamics of debate online are completely different from that of debate in real life, where interpersonal relationships and existing reputations are critically important. |

| [Exclusive: What to Expect From Sony's Next-Gen PlayStation](https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-sony-next-gen-console/) | From WIRED. Discusses the next generation Playstation's qualities and what will make it a standout gaming system, beyond updated graphics and processing power, to the "revolutionary" SSD memory storage that will change how people play with games and the resulting fidelity. There are two interesing points: firstly, that gaming systems are growing to become more like simulated environments than simply virtual worlds that people use merely for entertainment. Perhaps with interactive media, they might converge! Secondly, it's interesting that the world is increasingly defined by the transferability of data, not just the accumulation of it. Smart cars is one (sharing data), but also advances made possible by Google's Stadia and the ability to "load" instantaneously in this gaming set might indicate some interesting broader trend. Cool stuff! |

| [Microsoft loses control over Windows Tiles](https://www.golem.de/news/subdomain-takeover-microsoft-loses-control-over-windows-tiles-1904-140717.html) | From Golem.de. Microsoft forgets to delete some subdomain registration and loses its control to Windows Tiles. This is obviously bad for QA, but brings up another question - how can people ensure that updates happen well? The problem of updates is tied to [another story]() about how hardware locks in hotels are hard to change - how can companies ensure that they provide assurances of quality of updates, considering that cyberspace is about to rapidly become an arms race where frequent updates are critically important to maintaining security? One answer might be to use checklists, which [in Scotland](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47953541) reduced surgical deaths to 1/3 the previous level due to the erasure of "forgetfulness". Is it even feasible to introduce such a system? And even if it's inconvenient, is it still worth it? Interesting thoughts. |

| [Viruses Have a Secret, Altruistic Social Life](http://nautil.us/blog/viruses-have-a-secret-altruistic-social-life) | From Nautilus. Interesting because it once again highlights how cooperation doesn't arise from an arbitrary set of "feelings" (although we as humans have evolved stronger feelings that are fine tuned to incentivize long-term fitness in social interaction and reduce challenges of cooperation game-theoretically), but instead arises from natural survivability. The philosophical implications for artificial life are nice, because they may or may not naturally "obtain" incentivizes for long-term survival through cooperation. However, we also have to note that this cooperation arose naturally through natural selection, which implicates "surviving when others don't survive". That might be bad... |

| [You’re Not Getting Enough Sleep—and It’s Killing You](https://www.wired.com/story/youre-not-getting-enough-sleep-and-its-killing-you/) | From WIRED. An article that essentially restates a lot of known things about how sleep improves people's lives, yada yada. But important to read nonetheless, if not just to remind you all that you should be getting more sleep. No, really. Please do. |

| [Landowners are earning millions for carbon cuts that may not occur](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613326/californias-cap-and-trade-program-may-vastly-overestimate-emissions-cuts/) | From MIT Technology Review. Carbon offset initiatives such as California's cap-and-trade program invite false emission cuts and carbon credits that don't actually cut the amount of carbon they say they do. This is largely due to the nuances of each group that is involved in carbon offset, how they currently manage land, and how credits are counted depending on how they currently manage land. A critical issue, and how can one normalize for these different measurement abilities of different organizations? |

| [Most Tech Today Would be Frivolous to Ancient Scientists](http://nautil.us/blog/most-tech-today-would-be-frivolous-to-ancient-scientists) | From Nautilus. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure I agree with the premises of the interviewee in this article. It addresses how ancient technologies accomplish similar goals philosophically as modern technology. It also addresses how we philosophically and fundamentally haven't advanced so far beyond ancient tech, although the tools have changed. Nevertheless, the article is interesting because it calls into question our emphasis on progress - specifically, what kind of progress is being made? Is it efficiency and knowledge that is applied the exact same way as before? |

| [The News is a Waste of Your Time](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/news-waste-time) | From Nat Elieason. As promised the article about how news is a waste of your time, which is something I have only really recently heard about (but believe is true) last summer. It highlights how both TV and newspapers are incentivized to post "non-important" information to grab and keep user attention, and that most important news is something that can be gleaned from other people. I think this is true, and most current news is mostly noise, but one of the things that I wanted to gain from Ouranos was an understanding of more long-form (magazine) articles that have more investigative and interesting content that actually furthers understanding rather than trigger-happy news. But is that a justification, or is that really me being more thoughtful? I'd love to talk to somebody about this. |

| [News is bad for you – and giving up reading it will make you happier](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli) | From The Guardian. A second article about how news is bad for people. This has some interesting points: it goes through explanations of why news is irrelevant, stress-inducing, increases cognitive errors, etc. but also has an interesting point about how it inhibits thinking in general because links and other features of news are specifically engineered to increase the degree/networkability (I swear there's a word for this) of news, but instead interrupt your ability to concentrate and think deeply about an article. Also, just the utilitarian argumet of how reading news erases your free time to do other things. And the argument that news is about "the old" and therefore destroys creativity, instead of increasing the development of novel ways of thinking. All of these things are reasons why I have decided to post on Ouranos, to counteract some of the lack of critical thinking, draw conclusions across multiple similar or related articles, and to develop not only a stronger understanding of the world, but draw strong conclusions about the state of the world and thematic problems that consistently occur. |
