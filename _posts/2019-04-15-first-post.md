Welcome to the first assortment of articles from my (hopefully) bi-weekly Article Assortment, which will contains a quick summary and overview of all the sorts of articles I've been reading throughout the week! The purpose of this system is, for me, to encourage long-term recall of news articles I've read. Ideally, I'll be able to organize most of this information into discrete subjects. This is a test of a memory system that will hopefully allow me to become more knowledgeable and retain information more comprehensively.

For all my readers, however, this will be a good insight into what sorts of articles I like to read on the daily, and provide a view into my current studies at Duke University, and my self-identification as a futurist, world-builder, and technologist interested in solving critical world problems. Most of my news tends to focus on impacts of technology, cool tech and science developments, and global societal issues. However, I do pick up the occasional random interest stories such as one I highlight below (The Day the Dinosaurs Died, from The New Yorker)!

This first issue is a random summary of some of the more noteworthy articles I've read over the past month, along with a few select tidbits I've read over my past few years that I've remembered to save. They range from archaeology and artificial environments to AI, privacy, China, physics, and political tolerance, and follow broad themes of technology's impact and integration in our society, largely influenced by a Duke class centered on Info, Ethics, Tech & Policy. This batch will be longer than most, especially since I will be aiming to highlight the breadth of topics discussed, as well as some interesting articles over the course of a month.

### Readings:

| Article Title | Summary + Opinions |
|:--------:|:--------------------|
| [The Day the Dinosaurs Died](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) | From The New Yorker, a fascinating story about the archaeological discovery of direct effects that the Chicxulub Impact had on the dinosaurs and other life. Filled with archaeological intrigue (who knew) and amazing depictions of the last moments of the Cretaceous, and the first moments of the Tertiary period. |
|----
| [The Lost History of One of the World’s Strangest Science Experiments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/sunday-review/biosphere-2-climate-change.html) | From The New York Times, a story about the rise and fall of Biosphere 2, and failed experiments in testing the creation and sustainability of artificial environments! I thought there was an interesting quote about the mismanagement of Biosphere 2, and implications for our very own Biosphere 1. |
|----
| [Kamala Harris Wants to Give States Millions to Overhaul Tech](https://www.wired.com/story/kamala-harris-digital-services-act-2019/) | From WIRED, an article about the Digital Service Act of 2019, which seeks to bridge the technology gap between government and the private sector at the state level. States don't get the same level of resources to overhaul their systems as the national government. But isn't another way to bridge this gap the rise of interest of GovTech in industry? |
|----
| [The DNC's Technology Chief is Phishing His Staff. Good.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dncs-technology-chief-is-phishing-his-staff-good/) | From WIRED. Raffi Krikorian, the DNC's Chief Technology Officer, talks about his switch from industry to head of the DNC, and the numerous and often unique tech challenges that they face, such as the cyclic nature of campaign technology. This similarly ties in with the GovTech implication - businesses in that industry should rationally better long-term cybersecurity and increase maintainability. |

| [Google appoints an “AI council” to head off controversy, but it proves controversial](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613203/google-appoints-an-ai-council-to-head-off-controversy-but-it-proves-controversial/) | From MIT Technology Review. Google's new AI ethics council has proven to be quite controversial because of the inclusion of the Heritage Foundation (misinformation) and an executive of a drone weapons company. These seem to "run contrary" to ethics, but shouldn't different players be included on principle? |
|----
| [In The Face of Danger, We're Turning to Surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/surveillance-safety/) | From WIRED. How schools and businesses are turning to surveillance in order to counteract the danger of school shootings and lack of gun control. Personally, I agree with the ending conclusions about how the increase in long-term surveillance risk is a dangerous trade-off for decreased immediate risk of violence, especially with natural biases currently baked into systems. How will this hinder personal liberties? |
|----
| [The People Trying to Make Internet Recommendations Less Toxic](https://www.wired.com/story/people-trying-make-internet-recommendations-less-toxic/) | From WIRED. Discussing the quality implications of "black-box" recommendation systems, where the user doesn't get to decide what he/she wants, and how data is hoovered up to justify this nebulous "quality increase". I did not know there was a recommendation conference (RecSys) and that significant work has been done by many companies (e.g. Twitter) to increase utility of these systems. |

| [The out-there AI ideas designed to keep the US ahead of China](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613089/the-out-there-ai-ideas-designed-to-keep-the-us-ahead-of-china/) | From MIT Technology Review. China has presented a comprehensive AI plan meant to ensure Chinese dominance in the space, but the United States has been slower to respond. To keep up with rival growth, DARPA is aiming to address critical and novel AI ideas in the space. Some of these ideas are really "out-there" DARPA is developing includes automated accreditation of software systems and understanding how AI programs fail. One interesting thought - how much do institutions like DARPA shape the development of technology? Just thinking about how DARPA brought about the current autonomous driving boom with its DARPA Grand Challenge. |

| [How to Teach Artificial Intelligence Some Common Sense](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-teach-artificial-intelligence-common-sense/) | From WIRED. AI currently is very good at a specific range of tasks, but their ability to abstract and generalize at a broad level, even as they autonomously develop rules and "understanding" at a specific level, is almost non-existent. In Breakout, for instance, moving the paddle a few pixels up or down will completely destroy AI ability to play the game. Common sense will be critical if we deploy systems in the real-world, where the environment is chaotic. Some interesting approaches described in the article are knowledge graphs, and AI that can analyze idiomatic statements to derive intent, and draw logical conclusions. A funny quote: "With Deep Blue we had a program that would make a superhuman chess move—while the room was on fire." The crux of the issue, I would think. |
|----
| [Fei-Fei Li's Quest to Make AI Better for Humanity](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence-humanity/) | From WIRED. "Bias In, Bias Out" accurately describes artificial intelligence. Fei-Fei Li is trying to tackle the gender and racial bias in algorithms. This article is a nice, general overview of the state of ethics in Artificial Intelligence, and Fei-Fei Li's story as one of the pioneers in the ethical AI field. |

| [Who Should Own The Internet?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/opinion/julian-assange-on-living-in-a-surveillance-society.html) | From The New York Times. It's interesting to read an article from Julian Assange after his arrest and the recent view of his and WikiLeaks' actions as potentially irresponsible and deviating from the ethics of transparency. It says a lot of common themes about how privacy is a protection for the weak from the strong and how our society has developed into one of surveillance, both for intelligence and money (ads). I do think that his call to action is a reasonable one, though - "Humanity cannot now reject the Internet, but clearly we cannot surrender it either. Instead, we have to fight for it. Just as the dawn of atomic weapons inaugurated the Cold War, the manifold logic of the Internet is the key to understanding the approaching war for the intellectual center of our civilization." |
|----
| [The discrete-time physics hiding inside our continuous-time world](https://phys.org/news/2019-04-discrete-time-physics-continuous-time-world.html) | From Phys.org. An article about how continuous time events can be modelled using hidden states in discrete ways. This is particularly interesting because my AI class is currently talking about HMMs, POMDPs, and other Markov models. Maybe this has more applications than I thought! |
|----
| [The Least Politically Prejudiced Place in America](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/watertown-new-york-tops-scale-political-tolerance/582106/) | From The Atlantic. A great article about Watertown, in upstate New York, where political partisanship and prejudice is at one of the lowest levels in the country. This is largely attributed to how residents can't avoid each other, and have strong relationships before discussing political issues. Thus, even while they disagree, they can still have fruitful discussions where people are willing to talk to each other and learn! I wonder how this can be built into online systems, where the personal connection is almost inherently removed and there are critical changes to social dynamics that could change how people view each other, their community, and themselves. |

| [For Many Freelance Writers, Food Stamps Are The Only Way To Get By](https://theestablishment.co/for-many-freelance-writers-food-stamps-are-the-only-way-to-get-by-a34542bf58e8/) | From The Establishment. A fantastic highlight of the troubles that freelance professional writers go through, and how little they are valued by society. This changes the diverse perspectives that are able to write, which reduces one of the critically important things about freelancing - the perspectives which one might not see in a major outlet or publication. This also relates to the gig economy - how can society support independent creators (similar to what YouTube enabled with video content creators)? It also highlights the lacks of Facebook or Twitter, where journalists can get _views_, but not necessarily any money which is critical to their career. This was previously justified with page directs, but is this actually effective enough, especially as Facebook de-prioritizes news on its news feed. |
